This is a typing game.

The goal is to copy the functionality of a game called typing of the dead.

Text pops up, and you need to type the correct character to complete the sentence.

The plan is to use API's to generate the text. \* This didn't end up working out as to add another database I'd need to create one anyways. Also, It would give me more control over the quotes. Credit goes to https://api.kanye.rest/ as I just copied the JSON.

I plan on adding other small features to help me learn some other skills.
